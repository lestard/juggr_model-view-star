This repository contains examples for different UI design patterns based on *Model-View-Controller* like
*Model-View-Presenter* and *Model-View-ViewModel*.

It is created for a talk on this topic for the [Java User Group GÃ¶rlitz](http://www.jug-gr.de/2014/12/03/model-view-star.html).


The example application is a JavaFX client for a library. You can search for books and show the details of a selected book. 

The application is used from [Stefan Bley](https://github.com/sbley) and [his talk on Hypermedia APIs](https://github.com/sbley/hypermedia-library-client/tree/javafx). I was taking his example app and reimplemented it with different UI design patterns to show the differences in my talk. 

To run the examples you still need the Hypermedia REST-API from Stefan. You can find it [here](https://github.com/sbley/hypermedia-library-server). It's a simple java-ee webapplication that can be run in e.g. JBoss Wildfly.
